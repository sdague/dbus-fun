This is my set of random dbus scripts.  It needs a lot of cleaning up,
but worth getting out there for people.

Twitter and OAuth

Twitter is now using OAuth, which is cool.  They being really dumb
about validation of the secret token on desktop apps, which is bad.

My client keys are embedded because there is no other way to do it
with open source applications.  When run the first time it will pop up
a firefox window to get your token, after you've provided that you'll
need to added atoken and asecret to your accounts.yaml.
